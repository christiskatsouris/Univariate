The field of Time Series Econometrics focuses on the develompent of econometric methodologies for time series models. A crucial component for understanding the properties of such models is to study the time series properties of regressors and their associated underline stochastic processes. Economic time series are often decomposed into a deterministic trend and a stochastic process. Furthermore, a second aspect of concern is to distinguish "short-run" from "long-run" relationships. In particular, these long-run relationships are closely linked to the concepts of equilibrium relationships in economic theory and of persistence co-movements of economic time sereis in econometrics.      
## Introduction 

### Preliminary Concepts on Stochastic Processes

A stochastic process is an ordered sequence of random variables 

$$X_t : t \in T.$$
