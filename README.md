The field of Time Series Econometrics focuses on the develompent of econometric methodologies for time series models. A crucial component for understanding the properties of such models is to study the time series properties of regressors and their associated underline stochastic processes. Economic time series are often decomposed into a deterministic trend and a stochastic process.
